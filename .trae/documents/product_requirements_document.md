## 3. Core Process

**Learner Journey Flow:**
New learners begin with application and background verification, then complete onboarding and environment setup. They select a learning track (Frontend, Backend, AI/ML, or 10x Developer) and progress through structured modules with AI mentor support. Throughout their journey, they build portfolio projects, receive industry mentorship, and participate in job placement activities leading to employment outcomes.

**Mentor Workflow:**
Industry mentors join through partnership agreements, complete profile setup, and get matched with learners based on expertise and availability. They provide code reviews, conduct 1:1 sessions, and track learner progress while contributing to curriculum feedback.

**Employer Partner Process:**
Employer partners establish partnerships, post job opportunities, and access the talent pipeline through the platform. They participate in hiring events, conduct interviews, and provide feedback on graduate performance.
